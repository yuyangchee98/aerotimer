# AeroTimer

Timer that visualizes your work sessions as flights between airports on an interactive 3D globe.

## What it does

Select departure and arrival airports from around the world. Start a timer session and watch an airplane move along your chosen flight path as time progresses. When your session completes, you've "arrived" at your destination.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aerotimer.git
cd aerotimer
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. Search for departure and arrival airports by name, city, or airport code
2. Click start to begin your work session
3. Watch your progress on the globe as the airplane moves along the route
4. Complete your session to "land" at your destination
